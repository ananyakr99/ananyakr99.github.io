### Traffic Predictive Model for Fort Carson Military Base

Improved travel efficiency by leading a team of 6 graduate students to develop a predictive model using Python, forecasting road segment velocity and incidents, which also provided analytic recommendations on adverse weather response strategies. Enhanced decision-making for 70,000 military personnel by implementing advanced analytics and data modeling techniques using SQL and Python in a real-time ML model for travel efficiency to Ft. Carson base. Boosted cross-functional collaboration and communication by utilizing Agile methodologies and GitHub for version control and project management in the development of a real-time ML model for US Ignite. Optimized commute strategies for adverse weather by developing recommendations using Power BI and Excel for data visualization and analysis in a predictive model for road segment velocity and incidents.
